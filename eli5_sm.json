Hitler used this to gain a following by preaching pride in an indepent germany ( nationalism ) and helping the poor ( socialism , hence the Nazi : national socialist party ) . He grew incredibly popular , putting the entire workforce of Germany to work , and revolutionizing their industry and infrastructure . Then he decided Germany was n't enough , and took over a few countries . England demanded they stop , and Hitler agreed . Then he continued his conquest of Europe ( blitzkrieg ) . England had enough and went to war , but were eventually beaten back to their island , where the conflict became focused on aerial plane dogfights . England eventually won these . Meanwhile , Hitler had made a pact with Stalin to split up Poland . However , he betrayed him and attacked Russia , making great advances towards Moscow . Meanwhile , Japan attacked Pearl Harbour to neutralize the American navy and attack islands in the pacific . The US joined the war , sent marines to fight in the pacific , and their army to Europe . Then came D Day . US , UK and Canadian forces launched a major offensive into Europe , starting in France and advancing towards Berlin . The Russian army did the same thing , and started fighting back against Germany , until they eventually reached Berlin and declared victory over Germany . However , Japan and the US were still at war . To end it quickly , the US dropped the atomic bomb . That 's an EXTREMELY vague and probably slightly inaccurate summary of WW2 .",

                        "After WW1 , Germany was incredibly poor due to money they agreed to pay the countries they fought . Hitler used this to gain a following by preaching pride in an indepent germany ( nationalism ) and helping the poor ( socialism , hence the Nazi : national socialist party ) . He grew incredibly popular , putting the entire workforce of Germany to work , and revolutionizing their industry and infrastructure . Then he decided Germany was n't enough , and took over a few countries . England demanded they stop , and Hitler agreed . Then he continued his conquest of Europe ( blitzkrieg ) . England had enough and went to war , but were eventually beaten back to their island , where the conflict became focused on aerial plane dogfights . England eventually won these . Meanwhile , Hitler had made a pact with Stalin to split up Poland . However , he betrayed him and attacked Russia , making great advances towards Moscow . Meanwhile , Japan attacked Pearl Harbour to neutralize the American navy and attack islands in the pacific . The US joined the war , sent marines to fight in the pacific , and their army to Europe . Then came D Day . US , UK and Canadian forces launched a major offensive into Europe , starting in France and advancing towards Berlin . The Russian army did the same thing , and started fighting back against Germany , until they eventually reached Berlin and declared victory over Germany . However , Japan and the US were still at war . To end it quickly , the US dropped the atomic bomb . That 's an EXTREMELY vague and probably slightly inaccurate summary of WW2 .",

                        "I 'll take this . Edit incoming . EDIT : If you remember the days of dial - up , your computer was much slower at downloading things from the internet . Much longer ago , information was exchanged slower than that , such as in communications in wires under the ocean . We communicate digitally with lots of 1s and 0s - on settings and off settings - and bandwidth is how many 1s and 0s we can send at a time through the connection . Higher frequencies can carry more stuff , just like how TV signals can carry more information than radio signals , or how FM ( which is a higher frequency ) carries stereo sound instead of AM 's Mono . So you can get more bandwidth to your house with a better cable , but you also need a high quality connection , or else more of your 1s and 0s will be spent doing error checks to make sure that the rest of your signals are getting through . More errors = less speed . Your ISP has to get all of that data ( and there 's a lot of it ) into the internet . That can be tricky if there are distances involved , and it often means laying fiberoptic wires , which carries a large investment cost . To get that money back , the ISP charges more for people that use more bandwidth .",

                        "I 'll take this . Edit incoming . EDIT : If you remember the days of dial - up , your computer was much slower at downloading things from the internet . Much longer ago , information was exchanged slower than that , such as in communications in wires under the ocean . We communicate digitally with lots of 1s and 0s - on settings and off settings - and bandwidth is how many 1s and 0s we can send at a time through the connection . Higher frequencies can carry more stuff , just like how TV signals can carry more information than radio signals , or how FM ( which is a higher frequency ) carries stereo sound instead of AM 's Mono . So you can get more bandwidth to your house with a better cable , but you also need a high quality connection , or else more of your 1s and 0s will be spent doing error checks to make sure that the rest of your signals are getting through . More errors = less speed . Your ISP has to get all of that data ( and there 's a lot of it ) into the internet . That can be tricky if there are distances involved , and it often means laying fiberoptic wires , which carries a large investment cost .

There 's a lot of infrastructure in our nation that benefits us all as a whole . Sometimes we have permanent government employees who provide us services ( police , fire , schools , etc ) , and sometimes we hire contractors to get specific tasks done ( like pave roads , build bridges , or make bombs ) . The money that the government pays out to those people is then spent by those people at other businesses to buy food , goods , and services . The flow of money is what keeps our economy going . If the government decides it ca n't afford to pay for all of these people , it will stop . Those people will now be jobless and the money the government used to pay them is no longer flowing through the economy . If that money does n't get spent in other businesses , then those businesses have less money to spend on their employees , and a snowball effect happens as the economy gradually shrinks and unemployment grows . The reason why raising taxes can help is that it will take money from those who make a lot of it to pay for the services the government normally supplies , which in turn fuels the general economy . They can do this because there is a greater demand for government services than there is supply . Unlike the private sector , where overall there is greater supply than demand . So new jobs are n't getting created in the private sector because the economy is n't flowing . But there 's a great deal of demand from the public sector ( teachers , cops , road maintenance workers , etc ) , but we ( the government ) are refusing to invest in them because the economy is down . Why is that happening ? Likely because many people see the government as a giant business and think it should be run as such . And if you run a business and the economy slows down , you cut back . But the government is n't a business and in many ways behaves contrary to how a business would behave . That was the idea behind the stimulus : if the government spends money on the economy , it can help jump - start it with an influx of wealth . However , that requires a great deal of money , and since there is n't enough political support for raising taxes on the people with the most money , it forces us to borrow into further debt . And the fear of debt kept the stimulus relatively small , so it 's overall effect was limited . TL;DR - If taxes are raised , the government can fully fund its services without risking greater debt , which would put a lot of people back to work and put a lot of money back into the economy , which would in turn enable more private - sector jobs to be created .",

You have sneakily inserted a page 30 which tells the reader to give you all your money . At the start of the book there is a blank page where the reader can make notes . That 's your buffer . If you write in a bunch of text on that page , and the reader is too dumb to notice it 's happened , you could make your text overflow onto page one , and overwrite the text already there . So now , page one says \" If you choose to go left , turn to page 30 . If you choose to go right , turn to page 30 \" . So the reader turns to page 30 , and follows the instruction to give you all their money . You have overflowed the buffer to make the reader go to a page of your choosing rather than the legitimate pages . The book is your program , the blank page is the buffer , and page 30 is the malicious code . The text you dumped onto the blank page is your exploit code .",
